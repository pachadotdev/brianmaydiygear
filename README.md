# Brian May Inspired DIY Guitar Gear

I have collected information from different sources to provide schematics to build your own Treble Booster and Deacy Amp replicas.

In principle, a silicon transistor such as the N5088 works for the booster, and a transistor such as a Newmark AC187 will be much closer to the original build.

Most of the parts, except the vintage transistors, can be obtained from [Mouser Canada](https://mouser.ca).

These diagrams can be opened and edited with [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator). I also build these units one at a time and sell them on [Reverb](https://reverb.com/ca/shop/mauricios-gear-emporium-95).

## Notes

The treble booster provided here is an "average" of many commercial units no longer sold: Dallas Rangemaster, Brian May's homemade treble booster, Orange Treble Booster, Guild Power Booster (1986), Fryer Treble Booster.

The amp schematics serve both as a traditional amp or a preamp. If you build it as an amplifier, [this speaker](https://deacyamp.com/products/kat-dsp-6-5-tc-speaker-upgrade-for-vox-vbm-1-amplifier) works with it.
